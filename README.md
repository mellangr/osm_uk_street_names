# osm_uk_street_names
## Normalization of Ukrainian street names from OpenStreetMap

TSV-Table with normalized Ukrainian street names from the OpenStreetMap database. 

Recommendations for writing street names in Ukrainian: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Uk:Адреси#Визначення_реквізиту_адреси_«назва_вулиці»

If the name follows the guidelines, the data in the cells of both columns of the table are the same.

Problematic and incorrect names were filtered out. Normalization was performed semi-automatically, so there may be a small number of inaccuracies and errors.
